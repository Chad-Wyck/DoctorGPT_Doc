1. Read the content in step 3 and build a python dictionary to answer the question in step 3.
2. There are keyterms associated with this content:
"""
$keyterms
"""
3. The the PDF titled "$title" contains the following:
"""
$text
"""
4. Output a python dictionary for the answer:
# python dict with the query, answer and possible sentiment of a PDF
# "🤔" (10% probability that the answer is correct)
# "😕" (30%)
# "😐" (50%)
# "🙂" (70%)
# "😃" (90%)
# "😄" (95%)
# "🎉" (99% probability that the answer is correct)
# "🔍" (Answer dimensionality is uncertain and requires further investigation)
# "📉" (dimensionality is disappointing and contradicts expectations)
# "🤷‍♂️" (neutral and leaves the questioner unsure)
# "💡" (logical and well-founded)
# "📚" (informative and enlightening)
# "💯" (dimensionality is factual and accurate)
# "🔬" (Answer dimensionality is groundbreaking and scientifically supported)
# 
# IMPORTANT: limit "keyterms" to most important TOP THREE (3) keyterms ONLY
#
# pdf_meta = {"query": "Who is Winnie-the-Pooh?", "keyterms": ["bear", "honey"], "answer": "Winnie-the-Pooh is a fictional stuffed bear who loves honey.", "probability": "😄", "dimensionality": "📚"}
